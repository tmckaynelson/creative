            So you have found me, McKay Nelson. I am an aspiring web developer. Before I took my first programming class
            if you would have asked me if I wanted to be a developer I would have said no. In fact, I had been asked that
            question and the prospect of sitting behind a screen reading lines of gibberish did not seem appealing to me.
            After taking my first programming class however I found I thoroughly enjoy writing code. After spending a couple
            of years working as a Quality Assurance Intern on a company's web development I decided I wanted to do web
            development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in the small town of Perkasie, PA. I am a diehard Philadelphia Eagles fan. I also love to dance.
            Around the same time I discovered my love of programming, I also discovered my love of ballroom dance. I spent
            two years in BYU's Ballroom Dance program on their teams as well as competing individually. I also have found
            that I will defend the Second Amendmet. I thoroughly enjoy training and increasing my accuracy and speed with
            a firearm. My mother's favorite part of Christmas day is the carnage (her words). She loves the mess of paper
            and boxes strewn across the floor. I believe I inherited that as I love going out in the boonies with some
            friends and plinking at water bottles, glass bottles, and soda cans.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important aspects about me is that I am a proud member of The Church of Jesus Christ of
            Latter-day Saints. I was raised in LDS Church and thank my parents for that. I spent two years serving the
            Church and my Savior, Jesus Christ, in the Four Corners Area of the United States. I had the privilege of
            working with the Navajo and Ute people in that area. Those two years helped me learn some important lessons
            that I have been able to apply to my professional career. I will defend my faith and beliefs with confidence
            and patience. I am also happy to answer questions regarding my faith.
        </p>
